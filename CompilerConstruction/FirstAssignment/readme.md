This is my first programming assignment in my Compiler Construction course (CSC151, California State University, Sacramento).

To run this, you need to have GCC, make, flex, and bison.

This is pretty much just building a parser and setting up a Symbol Table and a Abstract Syntax Tree.

If you run the test script, it will make the file and run it against the 8 test cases that are given.
