# California State University - Sacramento (CSUS)

These are some of the classes that I have taken that I am most proud of!

Majority of my projects are done in my favorite language, C++, but I tried to include a variety of other projects that I felt accomplished with.

Since these are programs for school, some of them are simplified (such as only 1 file for files with many functions/methods). This is not pragmatic at all, but done so only for grading purposes.
