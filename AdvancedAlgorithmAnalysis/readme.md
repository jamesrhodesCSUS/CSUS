These are the 3 projects that I did in my Advanced Algorithms Class!

I did everything in my favoritie language, C++.

Dijkstra is just a simple implementation of the seraching algorithm.

ImprovedQuicksort was my project that implemented several sorting algorithms and I received extra credit for my special quicksort being able to beat the C++ library sort!

Branch and Bound is the knapsack problem; I solved it using several differnt methods, such as brute force, branch and bound (using 3 different pruning techniques), and dynamic programming.
